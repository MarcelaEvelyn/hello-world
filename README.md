On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.
Make and commit changes
Click the README.md file.
Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
Write a commit message that describes your changes.
Click Commit changes button.

These changes will be made to just the README file on your readme-edits branch, so now this branch contains content that’s different from master.

Step 4. Open a Pull Request
Nice edits! Now that you have changes in a branch off of master, you can open a pull request.
Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.
As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.
By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.
You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.

Screenshot
Click the  Pull Request tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green New pull request button.

In the Example Comparisons box, select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with master (the original).

Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit.

When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big green Create Pull Request button.

Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.

When you’re done with your message, click Create pull request!

Tip: You can use emoji and drag and drop images and gifs onto comments and Pull Requests.

Step 5. Merge your Pull Request
In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together – merging your readme-edits branch into the master branch.
Click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master.
Click Confirm merge.
Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the Delete branch button in the purple box.
 
Celebrate!
By completing this tutorial, you’ve learned to create a project and make a pull request on GitHub!   
Here’s what you accomplished in this tutorial:
Created an open source repository
Started and managed a new branch
Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
Opened and merged a Pull Request
Take a look at your GitHub profile and you’ll see your new contribution squares!
To learn more about the power of Pull Requests, we recommend reading the GitHub flow Guide. You might also visit GitHub Explore and get involved in an Open Source project
